    <p>Smart Glasses: Smart glasses, also known as augmented reality (AR) glasses, are worn like regular eyeglasses or sunglasses. They have a built-in display that overlays digital information onto the user's field of view. Smart glasses can provide hands-free access to notifications, navigation assistance, and interactive experiences. Examples of smart glasses include Google Glass, Microsoft HoloLens, and the Vuzix Blade.<br>

Virtual Reality (VR) Headsets: VR headsets are designed to provide an immersive virtual reality experience. They typically consist of a head-mounted display (HMD) that covers the user's eyes and may also include built-in headphones or earphones. VR headsets create a 3D virtual environment that users can explore and interact with. Some popular VR headsets include the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR.<br>

Sleep Trackers: Some wearable devices are designed specifically for sleep tracking and improvement. These devices, such as headbands or sleep masks, typically use sensors to monitor sleep patterns, including duration, quality, and stages of sleep. They provide insights and data to help users understand their sleep habits and optimize their sleep routines.<br>

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): BCIs are a type of wearable technology that interfaces directly with the brain to enable communication or control of external devices. They can be worn on the head and use sensors to detect brain activity, such as EEG (electroencephalography) signals. BCIs have applications in areas like assistive technology for individuals with disabilities, neurofeedback training, and research in brain-computer interaction.<br>

Headphones/Earphones: While primarily audio devices, headphones and earphones can also be considered wearable technology. They come in various forms, including wired and wireless options, and can be worn on or in the ears. Modern headphones often have additional features like noise cancellation, touch controls, voice assistants, and integration with mobile apps for personalized audio experiences.<br>

These are just a few examples of wearable technology that can be worn on the head. The field of wearable tech is rapidly evolving, and new innovations continue to emerge, expanding the possibilities of head-worn devices for various applications.<br>
